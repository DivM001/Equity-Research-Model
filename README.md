# Equity-Research-Model

The Equity Research Model is a machine learning-based system that helps investors make data-driven decisions about stock investments. The model uses a variety of financial indicators and metrics to evaluate companies, including:

    P/E Ratio
    Return on Equity (ROE)
    Return on Assets (ROA)
    Analyst target Price
    Current Ratio
    Quick Ratio
    Interest Coverage Ratio
    Operating Margin
   

By analyzing these metrics, the model provides a recommendation on whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock based on historical and real-time data.


Results

The model produces buy, sell, or hold recommendatios. These recommendations are provided alongside performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

For example:

    A stock with a high P/E ratio compared to same stocks in the industry might be recommended to sell if it is overpriced.
    A stock with a better ROE than its peers might be recommended to Buy
